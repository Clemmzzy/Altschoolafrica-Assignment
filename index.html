            <p class="BioText"> AltschoolAfrica is a great learning platform that has gained renowned influence in
                the educational Tech space. The Motivation from an Admiralable Mentor who has been of tremendous support to me,
                was what brought me to Altschoolafrica
                among the other various Tech learning platforms. The end goal of AltschoolAfrica really aligned with mine
                since i have great passion for the Tech and so eager to advance my knowledge in coding/programming. I intend to start with
                Backend Engineering and also learn FrontEnd Engineering, as the End goal is to be a Full Stack developer. Amazingly,
                the curriculum in the first semester has been structured in a way that gives a good introduction to Frontend Engineering
                before transitioning to our individual tracks. This will enable me build on the FrontEnd foundation laid,
                as well as focus on the Backend track properly.
